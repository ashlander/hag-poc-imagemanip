Description
===========

**Image manipulator** is PoC (proof-of-concept) image m_anipulation tool created with HaG game framework. The purpose is to create some tile based view, and get exact HaG manipulation command to achieve it. This project is capability testing of the HaG game framework.

_The greatest thing about the project - it took only **139** lines of scripting code (including comments and white spaces) and **half a day** of the time. See yarn_ directory for the source code.

Run It
======

**HaG** framework benefits from code generation and converts YarnSpinner_-like scripts into c++ code, creating entire server side web application. And you can play test it using docker.

I was happy to hear the author of dungeon tiles allowed me to use his great work in non-profit projects. So here we are, his tiles are included, but they do have other license, so mind that and ask author for permission.
